### What is Mira?

The Mira Accelerator fast-tracks the setup of common Amazon Web Services (AWS) Serverless infrastructure<sup>1</sup>. 
It is an opinionated toolkit on top of the AWS Cloud Development Kit.

It enables you to:
- Quickly bootstrap serverless, cloud native AWS applications.

 * Foundational constructs that simplify configuration of multiple application environments.
 * Bundled AWS CDK.
 * An opinionated set of AWS CDK aspects, e.g. IAM Policy validator. 
 * Complementary sample applications e.g. a simple S3-based web hosting app.
