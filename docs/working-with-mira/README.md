# Working With Mira
## Mira CLI
  - Developer friendly CLI, simply run `npx mira`.
      - init - option to initialize mandatory files.
      - deploy - option to deploy your application directly from your computer.
      - cicd - option to deploy shared CI Pipeline
      - docs - option to run a docsify webserver and see the Mira docs.

## Deploying S3 Bucket Content Only
(*Experimental Feature*)

Sometimes you want to only deploy changes made to S3 content, such as with frontends you wish to deploy.  It can be cumbersome to go through a stack changeset as this can take minutes.  You can use the `--s3-only` flag to attempt to deploy any assets that CDK would otherwise push up to S3 buckets.  This can shrink deployment times down to 15-30 seconds and allows you to share S3-connected assets easily.  To do this, you might run a command like:

`npx mira deploy myStackName --file=path/to/stackFile.js --s3-only`

Note, that this command will only work if you have already deployed this stack once before!  If it is successful, you should see the console log the HTTP-accessible location of your files:

![quick-deploy]

## Developing with Mira locally

You may want to author changes to the Mira package and immediately use those
changes in your Mira application.  You can do this using the following syntax
from your local Mira directory:

```
node scripts/link.js [APPLICATION_PATH]
```

For instance, if your application is at `../app` you'd run the script:

```
node scripts/link.js ../app
```

If you have an existing installation or Mira dependency installed in `../app` 
then Mira will copy it to `../app/mira.old`.  To reinstall a remote version of
Mira from GitHub or NPM just delete your `node_modules` folder and re-run 
`npm install` in your application directory.

Each time you make local changes to Mira, you will need to run `npm run build` within the `mira` package. Likewise, in your application: if you change your `package.json`, add or remove a dependency you will impact Mira and will need to re-run `npm install` and `node scripts/link [APPLICATION_PATH]`. This is because Mira symlinks itself into the application `node_modules` folder and running an `npm install` in the application will wipe modules that it thinks are not relevant, i.e. it will delete Mira's dependencies from its `node_modules`. This caveat may be later automated but is important to note at this time.

### Implementation Details

The reason Mira uses the `link` script found under `scripts/link.js` is because
of complications arising from AWS CDK requiring itself to be listed as a
peer dependency.  Utilizing the `--preserve-symlinks` flag alongside `npm link`
usage is not enough: Mira will still read `app/node_modules/mira/node_modules/aws-cdk`.

As a result of this, Mira implements the `link` script which will symlink in the
necessary files and dependencies to run Mira without symlinking the AWS CDK
dependencies intended to be used as peer dependencies.



## Troubleshooting

In case your application fails to deployed, make sure that your config it properly structured and your stack definition is correct.
Mira extracts the errors from the failed nested stacks to your terminal window, so it should help you to quickly find the root cause.

Typical issues includes:

* Version mismatch for the AWS CDK, between Mira and your local package.json.
* A `profile` property is not defined for all environments in the config file.
* The code you're trying to deploy was not complied with TypeScript after recent changes.

### Mira Dependencies

Keep in mind, AWS CDK requires all the modules to be the same version.
```json
{
    "aws-cdk": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-cloudformation": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-codebuild": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-codecommit": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-codepipeline": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-codepipeline-actions": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-iam": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-event-sources": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-lambda": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-s3-assets": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/custom-resources": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-sns": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-s3": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-sqs": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/assets": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-kms": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-ec2": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-rds": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-ssm": "1.89.0",
    "@aws-cdk/core": "1.89.0"
}
```

### CDK Version Mismatch

A version mismatch usually presents itself as a TypeScript Error when attempting to run a build. Below is an example error from the S3 web hosting sample:

```sh
âžœ npm run build

> s3-website@1.0.0 build /Users/nigelhanlon/Source/cdk-fun/s3-website
> tsc -p infra/

infra/src/index.ts:37:26 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'this' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Construct'.
  Type 'S3Website' is not assignable to type 'Construct'.
    Property 'onValidate' is protected but type 'Construct' is not a class derived from 'Construct'.

37     new BucketDeployment(this, 'Deployment', {
                            ~~~~


Found 1 error.

```

To resolve this, make sure each cdk related item and the cdk package itself all match the version number supported by Mira in your package.json file.

### Configuration Issues

If there is a problem with the configuration file, or the file itself is missing, you will be presented with an error similar to this:

```sh
WARNING: No configurations found in configuration directory:/Users/nigelhanlon/Source/cdk-fun/s3-website/config

Configuration property "app.name" is not defined, you will not be able to deploy your app yet.

/usr/local/lib/node_modules/mira/node_modules/config/lib/config.js:182
    throw new Error('Configuration property "' + property + '" is not defined');
          ^
Error: Configuration property "app.name" is not defined

    at Object.<anonymous> (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/mira/src/config/mira-config.ts:209:27)
    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:688:30)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:699:10)

    at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:537:12)
    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:529:3)
    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:636:17)
    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:20:18)

```

You can resolve this by running `npx mira init` or checking your configuration file matches the expected fields. 

### CDK Deployment Issues

On rare occasions you may need to recreate the CDK bootstrap environment. This environment is created when you run `cdk bootstrap` and sets up a workspace where temporary assets and configurations can be stored during deployment. This workspace can sometimes become corrupted and cause strange or unexplained failures such as permission issues. For example, on the S3 Sample application, it can manifest as a permission issue when attempting to copy files to the destination S3 bucket even though the deployment user may have administrator privilege.

If you have exhausted other possible causes and issues for a deployment failure, you can delete the CDK Toolkit and recreate it using the following steps:

- Login to the AWS Web Console
- (Optional) Switch Roles to match your deployment account
- Go to CloudFormation Tool
- Locate the `CDKToolkit` stack and highlight it
- Click `Delete` from the top menu bar and confirm.
- Once deleted you can bootstrap the CDK again as documented above.

*Please note* that if you delete the CDK Toolkit environment, you will not be able to deploy any new or existing Mira applications until it has been recreated. This also includes any configured CI/CD pipelines.
